25073180,A decision-support framework for promoting independent living and ageing well.,"Artificial intelligence and decision support systems offer a plethora of health monitoring capabilities in ambient assisted living environment. Continuous assessment of health indicators for elderly people living on their own is of utmost importance, so as to prolong their independence and quality of life. Slow varying, long-term deteriorating health trends are not easily identifiable in seniors. Thus, early sign detection of a specific condition, as well as, any likely transition from a healthy state to a pathological one are key problems that the herein proposed framework aims at resolving. Statistical process control concepts offer a personalized approach toward identification of trends that are away from the atypical behavior or state of the seniors, while fuzzy cognitive maps knowledge representation and inference schema have proved to be efficient in terms of disease classification. Geriatric depression is used as a case study throughout the paper, so to prove the validity of the framework, which is planned to be pilot tested with a series of lone-living seniors in their own homes."
30419365,A framework for data-driven adaptive GUI generation based on DICOM.,"Computer applications for diagnostic medical imaging provide generally a wide range of tools to support physicians in their daily diagnosis activities. Unfortunately, some functionalities are specialized for specific diseases or imaging modalities, while other ones are useless for the images under investigation. Nevertheless, the corresponding Graphical User Interface (GUI) widgets are still present on the screen reducing the image visualization area. As a consequence, the physician may be affected by cognitive overload and visual stress causing a degradation of performances, mainly due to unuseful widgets. In clinical environments, a GUI must represent a sequence of steps for image investigation following a well-defined workflow. This paper proposes a software framework aimed at addressing the issues outlined before. Specifically, we designed a DICOM based mechanism of data-driven GUI generation, referring to the examined body part and imaging modality as well as to the medical image analysis task to perform. In this way, the self-configuring GUI is generated on-the-fly, so that just specific functionalities are active according to the current clinical scenario. Such a solution provides also a tight integration with the DICOM standard, which considers various aspects of the technology in medicine but does not address GUI specification issues. The proposed workflow is designed for diagnostic workstations with a local file system on an interchange media acting inside or outside the hospital ward. Accordingly, the DICOMDIR conceptual data model, defined by a hierarchical structure, is exploited and extended to include the GUI information thanks to a new Information Object Module (IOM), which reuses the DICOM information model. The proposed framework exploits the DICOM standard representing an enabling technology for an auto-consistent solution in medical diagnostic applications. In this paper we present a detailed description of the framework, its software design, and a proof-of-concept implementation as a suitable plug-in of the OsiriX imaging software."
35421974,An implementation framework and a feasibility evaluation of a clinical decision support system for diabetes management in secondary mental healthcare using CogStack.,"BACKGROUND: Improvements to the primary prevention of physical health illnesses like diabetes in the general population have not been mirrored to the same extent in people with serious mental illness (SMI). This work evaluates the technical feasibility of implementing an electronic clinical decision support system (eCDSS) for supporting the management of dysglycaemia and diabetes in patients with serious mental illness in a secondary mental healthcare setting. METHODS: A stepwise approach was taken as an overarching and guiding framework for this work. Participatory methods were employed to design and deploy a monitoring and alerting eCDSS. The eCDSS was evaluated for its technical feasibility. The initial part of the feasibility evaluation was conducted in an outpatient community mental health team. Thereafter, the evaluation of the eCDSS progressed to a more in-depth in silico validation. RESULTS: A digital health intervention that enables monitoring and alerting of at-risk patients based on an approved diabetes management guideline was developed. The eCDSS generated alerts according to expected standards and in line with clinical guideline recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: It is feasible to design and deploy a functional monitoring and alerting eCDSS in secondary mental healthcare. Further work is required in order to fully evaluate the integration of the eCDSS into routine clinical workflows. By describing and sharing the steps that were and will be taken from concept to clinical testing, useful insights could be provided to teams that are interested in building similar digital health interventions."
30184559,Applying the RE-AIM Framework for the Evaluation of a Clinical Decision Support Tool for Pediatric Head Trauma: A Mixed-Methods Study.,"BACKGROUND: The overuse of cranial computed tomography (CT) to diagnose potential traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) exposes children with minor blunt head trauma to unnecessary ionizing radiation. The Pediatric Emergency Care Applied Research Network and the Clinical Research on Emergency Services and Treatments Network implemented TBI prediction rules via electronic health record (EHR) clinical decision support (CDS) to decrease use of CTs in children with minor blunt head trauma. OBJECTIVE: This article aims to facilitate implementation and dissemination of a CDS alert into emergency departments around the country. METHODS: We evaluated the EHR CT CDS tool through a mixed-methods analysis of 38 audio-recorded interviews with health care stakeholders and quantitative data sources, using the Reach, Efficacy, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework. RESULTS: Reach -: The demographics of participants enrolled in the clinical trial were consistent with national estimates of TBI prevalence. Efficacy-There was a variable and modest reduction in CT rates for the 8,067 children with minor head trauma whose clinicians received CDS. Adoption -: The EHR CT CDS tool was well matched with the organizational mission, values, and priorities of the implementation sites. Implementation- The most important predisposing factors for successful implementation were the presence of an approachable clinical champion at each site and belief that the tool was a relevant, reusable knowledge asset. Enabling factors included an effective integration within the clinical workflow, organizational investment in user training, and ease of use. Maintenance -: Reinforcing factors for the EHR CT CDS tool included a close fit with the institutional culture, belief that it was useful for providers and families, and a good educational and informational tool. As such, the EHR CT CDS tool was maintained in clinical practice long after study completion. CONCLUSION: Data from this mixed-methods study complement findings from the efficacy trial and provide critical components for consideration prior to integration and subsequent dissemination of the EHR CT CDS tool.

29295253,Arden Syntax Clinical Foundation Framework for Event Monitoring in Intensive Care Units: Report on a Pilot Study.,"The creation of clinical decision support systems has received a strong impulse over the last years, but their integration into a clinical routine has lagged behind, partly due to a lack of interoperability and trust by physicians. We report on the implementation of a clinical foundation framework in Arden Syntax, comprising knowledge units for (a) preprocessing raw clinical data, (b) the determination of single clinical concepts, and (c) more complex medical knowledge, which can be modeled through the composition and configuration of knowledge units in this framework. Thus, it can be tailored to clinical institutions or patients' caregivers. In the present version, we integrated knowledge units for several infection-related clinical concepts into the framework and developed a clinical event monitoring system over the framework that employs three different scenarios for monitoring clinical signs of bloodstream infection. The clinical event monitoring system was tested using data from intensive care units at Vienna General Hospital, Austria."
35033029,Assessing the implementation of a clinical decision support tool in primary care for diabetes prevention: a qualitative interview study using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Science.,"BACKGROUND: In this paper we describe the use of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) to study implementation of a web-based, point-of-care, EHR-linked clinical decision support (CDS) tool designed to identify and provide care recommendations for adults with prediabetes (Pre-D CDS). METHODS: As part of a large NIH-funded clinic-randomized trial, we identified a convenience sample of interview participants from 22 primary care clinics in Minnesota, North Dakota, and Wisconsin that were randomly allocated to receive or not receive a web-based EHR-integrated prediabetes CDS intervention. Participants included 11 clinicians, 6 rooming staff, and 7 nurse or clinic managers recruited by study staff to participate in telephone interviews conducted by an expert in qualitative methods. Interviews were recorded and transcribed, and data analysis was conducted using a constructivist version of grounded theory. RESULTS: Implementing a prediabetes CDS tool into primary care clinics was useful and well received. The intervention was integrated with clinic workflows, supported primary care clinicians in clearly communicating prediabetes risk and management options with patients, and in identifying actionable care opportunities. The main barriers to CDS use were time and competing priorities. Finally, while the implementation process worked well, opportunities remain in engaging the care team more broadly in CDS use. CONCLUSIONS: The use of CDS tools for engaging patients and providers in care improvement opportunities for prediabetes is a promising and potentially effective strategy in primary care settings. A workflow that incorporates the whole care team in the use of such tools may optimize the implementation of CDS tools like these in primary care settings.

36027798,Barriers and facilitators to implementing a nursing clinical decision support system in a tertiary hospital setting: A qualitative study using the FITT framework.,"OBJECTIVE: Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been increasingly introduced to health care settings; however, their adoption is far from ideal. Guided by the FITT framework, this study aims to explore barriers and facilitators to the implementation of a CDSS from the perspective of nurses. METHODS: A qualitative study with 200 h of participatory observation and 21 semi structured interviews was conducted from February to August 2021 in four medical-surgical wards in a 2000-bed tertiary hospital in Shanghai, China. The field notes were typed and the audio-recorded interviews were transcribed to texts verbatim and were coded with a four-step approach. We used the FITT framework to interpret our findings based on the technology, individual and task attributes and the fit between them. RESULTS: A total of twelve categories were identified, which were integrated into two themes: barriers and facilitators to system implementation. All categories but one can be mapped to the three attributes of the FITT framework: technology, individual and task. We assumed that management has a vital role to play in the following areas: addressing user resistance, improving system usability, setting standards on practice and, finally, building connectivity between nurses and the technical staff to improve the fit between the technology, individual and task attribute and thus promote system implementation. CONCLUSION: Barriers and facilitators to CDSS implementation include system-related, user-related and organizational factors which can largely be fit into the FITT framework. There is potential to extend the FITT framework to represent management intervention on inter-disciplinary collaboration. Future empirical studies on facilitating strategies from the management to improve user experience and willingness of CDSS adoption are needed."
26958259,Challenges and Solutions in Optimizing Execution Performance of a Clinical Decision Support-Based Quality Measurement (CDS-QM) Framework.,"Given the close relationship between clinical decision support (CDS) and quality measurement (QM), it has been proposed that a standards-based CDS Web service could be leveraged to enable QM. Benefits of such a CDS-QM framework include semantic consistency and implementation efficiency. However, earlier research has identified execution performance as a critical barrier when CDS-QM is applied to large populations. Here, we describe challenges encountered and solutions devised to optimize CDS-QM execution performance. Through these optimizations, the CDS-QM execution time was optimized approximately three orders of magnitude, such that approximately 370,000 patient records can now be evaluated for 22 quality measure groups in less than 5 hours (approximately 2 milliseconds per measure group per patient). Several key optimization methods were identified, with the most impact achieved through population-based retrieval of relevant data, multi-step data staging, and parallel processing. These optimizations have enabled CDS-QM to be operationally deployed at an enterprise level."
29025114,"Comprehensive process model of clinical information interaction in primary care: results of a ""best-fit"" framework synthesis.","OBJECTIVE: To describe a new, comprehensive process model of clinical information interaction in primary care (Clinical Information Interaction Model, or CIIM) based on a systematic synthesis of published research. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the ""best fit"" framework synthesis approach. Searches were performed in PubMed, Embase, the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PsycINFO, Library and Information Science Abstracts, Library, Information Science and Technology Abstracts, and Engineering Village. Two authors reviewed articles according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data abstraction and content analysis of 443 published papers were used to create a model in which every element was supported by empirical research. RESULTS: The CIIM documents how primary care clinicians interact with information as they make point-of-care clinical decisions. The model highlights 3 major process components: (1) context, (2) activity (usual and contingent), and (3) influence. Usual activities include information processing, source-user interaction, information evaluation, selection of information, information use, clinical reasoning, and clinical decisions. Clinician characteristics, patient behaviors, and other professionals influence the process. DISCUSSION: The CIIM depicts the complete process of information interaction, enabling a grasp of relationships previously difficult to discern. The CIIM suggests potentially helpful functionality for clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) to support primary care, including a greater focus on information processing and use. The CIIM also documents the role of influence in clinical information interaction; influencers may affect the success of CDSS implementations. CONCLUSION: The CIIM offers a new framework for achieving CDSS workflow integration and new directions for CDSS design that can support the work of diverse primary care clinicians."
28648871,Creation of an Open Framework for Point-of-Care Computer-Assisted Reporting and Decision Support Tools for Radiologists.,"Decreasing unnecessary variation in radiology reporting and producing guideline-concordant reports is fundamental to radiology's success in value-based payment models and good for patient care. In this article, we present an open authoring system for point-of-care clinical decision support tools integrated into the radiologist reporting environment referred to as the computer-assisted reporting and decision support (CAR/DS) framework. The CAR/DS authoring system, described herein, includes: (1) a definition format for representing radiology clinical guidelines as structured, machine-readable Extensible Markup Language documents and (2) a user-friendly reference implementation to test the fidelity of the created definition files with the clinical guideline. The proposed definition format and reference implementation will enable content creators to develop CAR/DS tools that voice recognition software (VRS) vendors can use to extend the commercial tools currently in use. In making the definition format and reference implementation software freely available, we hope to empower individual radiologists, expert groups such as the ACR, and VRS vendors to develop a robust ecosystem of CAR/DS tools that can further improve the quality and efficiency of the patient care that our field provides. We hope that this initial effort can serve as the basis for a community-owned open standard for guideline definition that the imaging informatics and VRS vendor communities will embrace and strengthen. To this end, the ACR Assist initiative is intended to make the College's clinical content, including the Incidental Findings Committee White Papers, available for decision support tool creation based upon the herein described CAR/DS framework."
30311556,Design Framework for a Data Mart in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.,"Neonates who are critically ill are cared for in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) for continuous monitoring of their conditions. Physiological parameters such as heart rate, respiratory wave form, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature are constantly monitored in the NICU. However, NICUs are not always equipped with a computer system for analyzing such data, identifying critical events, and providing decision support for a neonatologist. Therefore, a specialized computer system, commonly known as a data mart, should be developed for the NICU. An architectural framework for the design and development of an automated system for data collection, storage, and analysis for the NICU is proposed in this paper. Our study also deals with the implementation of advanced transformation functions such as fuzzy grouping and fuzzy lookup for data preparation and preprocessing. Furthermore, based on Kimball's dimensional modeling, a data gathering and accumulation system, fact constellation schema (galaxy schema) has been built with previously identified neonatal processes. Finally, an information delivery component has been proposed, wherein the neonatal data can be both analyzed with different data mining algorithms and visualized with various metrics. Our pioneering work demonstrates methods that streamline the process of data collection, data storage, analysis, and decision-making, which in turn increases efficiency in the NICU and saves lives. Our study, presented in this paper, describes the design and development process and discusses its utility in the NICU. Our results indicate that data mart is best suited for effective decision-making in the NICU."
37495997,Identifying barriers and facilitators to successful implementation of computerized clinical decision support systems in hospitals: a NASSS framework-informed scoping review.,"BACKGROUND: Successful implementation and utilization of Computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) in hospitals is complex and challenging. Implementation science, and in particular the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) framework, may offer a systematic approach for identifying and addressing these challenges. This review aimed to identify, categorize, and describe barriers and facilitators to CDSS implementation in hospital settings and map them to the NASSS framework. Exploring the applicability of the NASSS framework to CDSS implementation was a secondary aim. METHODS: Electronic database searches were conducted (21 July 2020; updated 5 April 2022) in Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Scopus, PyscInfo, and CINAHL. Original research studies reporting on measured or perceived barriers and/or facilitators to implementation and adoption of CDSS in hospital settings, or attitudes of healthcare professionals towards CDSS were included. Articles with a primary focus on CDSS development were excluded. No language or date restrictions were applied. We used qualitative content analysis to identify determinants and organize them into higher-order themes, which were then reflexively mapped to the NASSS framework. RESULTS: Forty-four publications were included. These comprised a range of study designs, geographic locations, participants, technology types, CDSS functions, and clinical contexts of implementation. A total of 227 individual barriers and 130 individual facilitators were identified across the included studies. The most commonly reported influences on implementation were fit of CDSS with workflows (19 studies), the usefulness of the CDSS output in practice (17 studies), CDSS technical dependencies and design (16 studies), trust of users in the CDSS input data and evidence base (15 studies), and the contextual fit of the CDSS with the user's role or clinical setting (14 studies). Most determinants could be appropriately categorized into domains of the NASSS framework with barriers and facilitators in the ""Technology,"" ""Organization,"" and ""Adopters"" domains most frequently reported. No determinants were assigned to the ""Embedding and Adaptation Over Time"" domain. CONCLUSIONS: This review identified the most common determinants which could be targeted for modification to either remove barriers or facilitate the adoption and use of CDSS within hospitals. Greater adoption of implementation theory should be encouraged to support CDSS implementation."
31888718,The NASSS framework for ex post theorisation of technology-supported change in healthcare: worked example of the TORPEDO programme.,"BACKGROUND: Evaluation of health technology programmes should be theoretically informed, interdisciplinary, and generate in-depth explanations. The NASSS (non-adoption, abandonment, scale-up, spread, sustainability) framework was developed to study unfolding technology programmes in real time-and in particular to identify and manage their emergent uncertainties and interdependencies. In this paper, we offer a worked example of how NASSS can also inform ex post (i.e. retrospective) evaluation. METHODS: We studied the TORPEDO (Treatment of Cardiovascular Risk in Primary Care using Electronic Decision Support) research programme, a multi-faceted computerised quality improvement intervention for cardiovascular disease prevention in Australian general practice. The technology (HealthTracker) had shown promise in a cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT), but its uptake and sustainability in a real-world implementation phase was patchy. To explain this variation, we used NASSS to undertake secondary analysis of the multi-modal TORPEDO dataset (results and process evaluation of the RCT, survey responses, in-depth professional interviews, videotaped consultations) as well as a sample of new, in-depth narrative interviews with TORPEDO researchers. RESULTS: Ex post analysis revealed multiple areas of complexity whose influence and interdependencies helped explain the wide variation in uptake and sustained use of the HealthTracker technology: the nature of cardiovascular risk in different populations, the material properties and functionality of the technology, how value (financial and non-financial) was distributed across stakeholders in the system, clinicians' experiences and concerns, organisational preconditions and challenges, extra-organisational influences (e.g. policy incentives), and how interactions between all these influences unfolded over time. CONCLUSION: The NASSS framework can be applied retrospectively to generate a rich, contextualised narrative of technology-supported change efforts and the numerous interacting influences that help explain its successes, failures, and unexpected events. A NASSS-informed ex post analysis can supplement earlier, contemporaneous evaluations to uncover factors that were not apparent or predictable at the time but dynamic and emergent."
38053104,21st century (clinical) decision support in nursing and allied healthcare. Developing a learning health system: a reasoned design of a theoretical framework.,"In this paper, we present a framework for developing a Learning Health System (LHS) to provide means to a computerized clinical decision support system for allied healthcare and/or nursing professionals. LHSs are well suited to transform healthcare systems in a mission-oriented approach, and is being adopted by an increasing number of countries. Our theoretical framework provides a blueprint for organizing such a transformation with help of evidence based state of the art methodologies and techniques to eventually optimize personalized health and healthcare. Learning via health information technologies using LHS enables users to learn both individually and collectively, and independent of their location. These developments demand healthcare innovations beyond a disease focused orientation since clinical decision making in allied healthcare and nursing is mainly based on aspects of individuals' functioning, wellbeing and (dis)abilities. Developing LHSs depends heavily on intertwined social and technological innovation, and research and development. Crucial factors may be the transformation of the Internet of Things into the Internet of FAIR data & services. However, Electronic Health Record (EHR) data is in up to 80% unstructured including free text narratives and stored in various inaccessible data warehouses. Enabling the use of data as a driver for learning is challenged by interoperability and reusability.To address technical needs, key enabling technologies are suitable to convert relevant health data into machine actionable data and to develop algorithms for computerized decision support. To enable data conversions, existing classification and terminology systems serve as definition providers for natural language processing through (un)supervised learning.To facilitate clinical reasoning and personalized healthcare using LHSs, the development of personomics and functionomics are useful in allied healthcare and nursing. Developing these omics will be determined via text and data mining. This will focus on the relationships between social, psychological, cultural, behavioral and economic determinants, and human functioning.Furthermore, multiparty collaboration is crucial to develop LHSs, and man-machine interaction studies are required to develop a functional design and prototype. During development, validation and maintenance of the LHS continuous attention for challenges like data-drift, ethical, technical and practical implementation difficulties is required."
32759098,A Conceptual Framework to Study the Implementation of Clinical Decision Support Systems (BEAR): Literature Review and Concept Mapping.,"BACKGROUND: The implementation of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) as an intervention to foster clinical practice change is affected by many factors. Key factors include those associated with behavioral change and those associated with technology acceptance. However, the literature regarding these subjects is fragmented and originates from two traditionally separate disciplines: implementation science and technology acceptance. OBJECTIVE: Our objective is to propose an integrated framework that bridges the gap between the behavioral change and technology acceptance aspects of the implementation of CDSSs. METHODS: We employed an iterative process to map constructs from four contributing frameworks-the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF); the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR); the Human, Organization, and Technology-fit framework (HOT-fit); and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT)-and the findings of 10 literature reviews, identified through a systematic review of reviews approach. RESULTS: The resulting framework comprises 22 domains: agreement with the decision algorithm; attitudes; behavioral regulation; beliefs about capabilities; beliefs about consequences; contingencies; demographic characteristics; effort expectancy; emotions; environmental context and resources; goals; intentions; intervention characteristics; knowledge; memory, attention, and decision processes; patient-health professional relationship; patient's preferences; performance expectancy; role and identity; skills, ability, and competence; social influences; and system quality. We demonstrate the use of the framework providing examples from two research projects. CONCLUSIONS: We proposed BEAR (BEhavior and Acceptance fRamework), an integrated framework that bridges the gap between behavioral change and technology acceptance, thereby widening the view established by current models."
26262059,A Decision Fusion Framework for Treatment Recommendation Systems.,"Treatment recommendation is a nontrivial task--it requires not only domain knowledge from evidence-based medicine, but also data insights from descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis. A single treatment recommendation system is usually trained or modeled with a limited (size or quality) source. This paper proposes a decision fusion framework, combining both knowledge-driven and data-driven decision engines for treatment recommendation. End users (e.g. using the clinician workstation or mobile apps) could have a comprehensive view of various engines' opinions, as well as the final decision after fusion. For implementation, we leverage several well-known fusion algorithms, such as decision templates and meta classifiers (of logistic and SVM, etc.). Using an outcome-driven evaluation metric, we compare the fusion engine with base engines, and our experimental results show that decision fusion is a promising way towards a more valuable treatment recommendation."
37414544,A lifecycle framework illustrates eight stages necessary for realizing the benefits of patient-centered clinical decision support.,"The design, development, implementation, use, and evaluation of high-quality, patient-centered clinical decision support (PC CDS) is necessary if we are to achieve the quintuple aim in healthcare. We developed a PC CDS lifecycle framework to promote a common understanding and language for communication among researchers, patients, clinicians, and policymakers. The framework puts the patient, and/or their caregiver at the center and illustrates how they are involved in all the following stages: Computable Clinical Knowledge, Patient-specific Inference, Information Delivery, Clinical Decision, Patient Behaviors, Health Outcomes, Aggregate Data, and patient-centered outcomes research (PCOR) Evidence. Using this idealized framework reminds key stakeholders that developing, deploying, and evaluating PC-CDS is a complex, sociotechnical challenge that requires consideration of all 8 stages. In addition, we need to ensure that patients, their caregivers, and the clinicians caring for them are explicitly involved at each stage to help us achieve the quintuple aim."
29246790,Clinical decision support models and frameworks: Seeking to address research issues underlying implementation successes and failures.,"Computer-based clinical decision support (CDS) has been pursued for more than five decades. Despite notable accomplishments and successes, wide adoption and broad use of CDS in clinical practice has not been achieved. Many issues have been identified as being partially responsible for the relatively slow adoption and lack of impact, including deficiencies in leadership, recognition of purpose, understanding of human interaction and workflow implications of CDS, cognitive models of the role of CDS, and proprietary implementations with limited interoperability and sharing. To address limitations, many approaches have been proposed and evaluated, drawing on theoretical frameworks, as well as management, technical and other disciplines and experiences. It seems clear, because of the multiple perspectives involved, that no single model or framework is adequate to encompass these challenges. This Viewpoint paper seeks to review the various foci of CDS and to identify aspects in which theoretical models and frameworks for CDS have been explored or could be explored and where they might be expected to be most useful."
27939413,Comprehensive mitigation framework for concurrent application of multiple clinical practice guidelines.,"In this work we propose a comprehensive framework based on first-order logic (FOL) for mitigating (identifying and addressing) interactions between multiple clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) applied to a multi-morbid patient while also considering patient preferences related to the prescribed treatment. With this framework we respond to two fundamental challenges associated with clinical decision support: (1) concurrent application of multiple CPGs and (2) incorporation of patient preferences into the decision making process. We significantly expand our earlier research by (1) proposing a revised and improved mitigation-oriented representation of CPGs and secondary medical knowledge for addressing adverse interactions and incorporating patient preferences and (2) introducing a new mitigation algorithm. Specifically, actionable graphs representing CPGs allow for parallel and temporal activities (decisions and actions). Revision operators representing secondary medical knowledge support temporal interactions and complex revisions across multiple actionable graphs. The mitigation algorithm uses the actionable graphs, revision operators and available (and possibly incomplete) patient information represented in FOL. It relies on a depth-first search strategy to find a valid sequence of revisions and uses theorem proving and model finding techniques to identify applicable revision operators and to establish a management scenario for a given patient if one exists. The management scenario defines a safe (interaction-free) and preferred set of activities together with possible patient states. We illustrate the use of our framework with a clinical case study describing two patients who suffer from chronic kidney disease, hypertension, and atrial fibrillation, and who are managed according to CPGs for these diseases. While in this paper we are primarily concerned with the methodological aspects of mitigation, we also briefly discuss a high-level proof of concept implementation of the proposed framework in the form of a clinical decision support system (CDSS). The proposed mitigation CDSS ""insulates"" clinicians from the complexities of the FOL representations and provides semantically meaningful summaries of mitigation results. Ultimately we plan to implement the mitigation CDSS within our MET (Mobile Emergency Triage) decision support environment."
27002818,Design and Development of a Sharable Clinical Decision Support System Based on a Semantic Web Service Framework.,"Clinical decision support (CDS) systems provide clinicians and other health care stakeholders with patient-specific assessments or recommendations to aid in the clinical decision-making process. Despite their demonstrated potential for improving health care quality, the widespread availability of CDS systems has been limited mainly by the difficulty and cost of sharing CDS knowledge among heterogeneous healthcare information systems. The purpose of this study was to design and develop a sharable clinical decision support (S-CDS) system that meets this challenge. The fundamental knowledge base consists of independent and reusable knowledge modules (KMs) to meet core CDS needs, wherein each KM is semantically well defined based on the standard information model, terminologies, and representation formalisms. A semantic web service framework was developed to identify, access, and leverage these KMs across diverse CDS applications and care settings. The S-CDS system has been validated in two distinct client CDS applications. Model-level evaluation results confirmed coherent knowledge representation. Application-level evaluation results reached an overall accuracy of 98.66 % and a completeness of 96.98 %. The evaluation results demonstrated the technical feasibility and application prospect of our approach. Compared with other CDS engineering efforts, our approach facilitates system development and implementation and improves system maintainability, scalability and efficiency, which contribute to the widespread adoption of effective CDS within the healthcare domain."
31664998,Developing a framework for evidence-based grading and assessment of predictive tools for clinical decision support.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical predictive tools quantify contributions of relevant patient characteristics to derive likelihood of diseases or predict clinical outcomes. When selecting predictive tools for implementation at clinical practice or for recommendation in clinical guidelines, clinicians are challenged with an overwhelming and ever-growing number of tools, most of which have never been implemented or assessed for comparative effectiveness. To overcome this challenge, we have developed a conceptual framework to Grade and Assess Predictive tools (GRASP) that can provide clinicians with a standardised, evidence-based system to support their search for and selection of efficient tools. METHODS: A focused review of the literature was conducted to extract criteria along which tools should be evaluated. An initial framework was designed and applied to assess and grade five tools: LACE Index, Centor Score, Well's Criteria, Modified Early Warning Score, and Ottawa knee rule. After peer review, by six expert clinicians and healthcare researchers, the framework and the grading of the tools were updated. RESULTS: GRASP framework grades predictive tools based on published evidence across three dimensions: 1) Phase of evaluation; 2) Level of evidence; and 3) Direction of evidence. The final grade of a tool is based on the highest phase of evaluation, supported by the highest level of positive evidence, or mixed evidence that supports a positive conclusion. Ottawa knee rule had the highest grade since it has demonstrated positive post-implementation impact on healthcare. LACE Index had the lowest grade, having demonstrated only pre-implementation positive predictive performance. CONCLUSION: GRASP framework builds on widely accepted concepts to provide standardised assessment and evidence-based grading of predictive tools. Unlike other methods, GRASP is based on the critical appraisal of published evidence reporting the tools' predictive performance before implementation, potential effect and usability during implementation, and their post-implementation impact. Implementing the GRASP framework as an online platform can enable clinicians and guideline developers to access standardised and structured reported evidence of existing predictive tools. However, keeping GRASP reports up-to-date would require updating tools' assessments and grades when new evidence becomes available, which can only be done efficiently by employing semi-automated methods for searching and processing the incoming information."
35308989,Enhancing the IDEAS Framework with Ontology: Designing Digital Interventions for Improving Cancer Patients' Wellbeing.,"Developing effective digital interventions to help patients form healthy habits is a challenging goal. IDEAS is a step-by-step framework that allows developers to draw ideas from intended users and behavioral theories, and ideate implementation strategies for them, followed by rapid prototype development. Based on our long experience with developing generic knowledge-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and integrating them with electronic health records (EHR) to deliver patient-specific advice, we observed a challenge that IDEAS is not addressing: the semantic detailing of the clinical knowledge behind the digital intervention and relevant patient data that could be used to personalize the digital intervention. To close the gap, we augmented two steps of IDEAS with an ontology that structures the target behavior as classes, derived from HL7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources standard. We exemplify the augmented IDEAS with a case study taken from the Horizon 2020 CAPABLE project, that uses Fogg's Tiny Habits behavioral model to improve the sleep of cancer patients via Tai Chi."
34516438,"Enhancing the value to users of machine learning-based clinical decision support tools: A framework for iterative, collaborative development and implementation.","BACKGROUND: Health care organizations are integrating a variety of machine learning (ML)-based clinical decision support (CDS) tools into their operations, but practitioners lack clear guidance regarding how to implement these tools so that they assist end users in their work. PURPOSE: We designed this study to identify how health care organizations can facilitate collaborative development of ML-based CDS tools to enhance their value for health care delivery in real-world settings. METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: We utilized qualitative methods, including 37 interviews in a large, multispecialty health system that developed and implemented two operational ML-based CDS tools in two of its hospital sites. We performed thematic analyses to inform presentation of an explanatory framework and recommendations. RESULTS: We found that ML-based CDS tool development and implementation into clinical workflows proceeded in four phases: iterative solution coidentification, iterative coengagement, iterative coapplication, and iterative corefinement. Each phase is characterized by a collaborative back-and-forth process between the technology's developers and users, through which both users' activities and the technology itself are transformed. CONCLUSION: Health care organizations that anticipate iterative collaboration to be an integral aspect of their ML-based CDS tools' development and implementation process may have more success in deploying ML-based CDS tools that assist end users in their work than organizations that expect a traditional technology innovation process. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Managers developing and implementing ML-based CDS tools should frame the work as a collaborative learning opportunity for both users and the technology itself and should solicit constructive feedback from users on potential changes to the technology, in addition to potential changes to user workflows, in an ongoing, iterative manner."
37853386,Improving computerized decision support system interventions: a qualitative study combining the theoretical domains framework with the GUIDES Checklist.,"BACKGROUND: Computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can improve care by bridging knowledge to practice gaps. However, the real-world uptake of such systems in health care settings has been suboptimal. We sought to: (1) use the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to identify determinants (barriers/enablers) of uptake of the Electronic Asthma Management System (eAMS) CDSS; (2) match identified TDF belief statements to elements in the Guideline Implementation with Decision Support (GUIDES) Checklist; and (3) explore the relationship between the TDF and GUIDES frameworks and the usefulness of this sequential approach for identifying opportunities to improve CDSS uptake. METHODS: In Phase 1, we conducted semistructured interviews with primary care physicians in Toronto, Canada regarding the uptake of the eAMS CDSS. Using content analysis, two coders independently analyzed interview transcripts guided by the TDF to generate themes representing barriers and enablers to CDSS uptake. In Phase 2, the same reviewers independently mapped each belief statement to a GUIDES domain and factor. We calculated the proportion of TDF belief statements that linked to each GUIDES domain and the proportion of TDF domains that linked to GUIDES factors (and vice-versa) and domains. RESULTS: We interviewed 10 participants before data saturation. In Phase 1, we identified 53 belief statements covering 12 TDF domains; 18 (34.0%) were barriers, and 35 (66.0%) were enablers. In Phase 2, 41 statements (77.4%) linked to at least one GUIDES factor, while 12 (22.6%) did not link to any specific factor. The GUIDES Context Domain was linked to the largest number of belief statements (19/53; 35.8%). Each TDF domain linked to one or more GUIDES factor, with 6 TDF domains linking to more than 1 factor and 8 TDF domains linking to more than 1 GUIDES domain. CONCLUSIONS: The TDF provides unique insights into barriers and enablers to CDSS uptake, which can then be mapped to GUIDES domains and factors to identify required changes to CDSS context, content, and system. This can be followed by conventional mapping of TDF domains to behaviour change techniques to optimize CDSS implementation. This novel step-wise approach combines two established frameworks to optimize CDSS interventions, and requires prospective validation."
37851492,"Using Theories, Models, and Frameworks to Inform Implementation Cycles of Computerized Clinical Decision Support Systems in Tertiary Health Care Settings: Scoping Review.","BACKGROUND: Computerized clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are essential components of modern health system service delivery, particularly within acute care settings such as hospitals. Theories, models, and frameworks may assist in facilitating the implementation processes associated with CDSS innovation and its use within these care settings. These processes include context assessments to identify key determinants, implementation plans for adoption, promoting ongoing uptake, adherence, and long-term evaluation. However, there has been no prior review synthesizing the literature regarding the theories, models, and frameworks that have informed the implementation and adoption of CDSSs within hospitals. OBJECTIVE: This scoping review aims to identify the theory, model, and framework approaches that have been used to facilitate the implementation and adoption of CDSSs in tertiary health care settings, including hospitals. The rationales reported for selecting these approaches, including the limitations and strengths, are described. METHODS: A total of 5 electronic databases were searched (CINAHL via EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Embase) to identify studies that implemented or adopted a CDSS in a tertiary health care setting using an implementation theory, model, or framework. No date or language limits were applied. A narrative synthesis was conducted using full-text publications and abstracts. Implementation phases were classified according to the ""Active Implementation Framework stages"": exploration (feasibility and organizational readiness), installation (organizational preparation), initial implementation (initiating implementation, ie, training), full implementation (sustainment), and nontranslational effectiveness studies. RESULTS: A total of 81 records (42 full text and 39 abstracts) were included. Full-text studies and abstracts are reported separately. For full-text studies, models (18/42, 43%), followed by determinants frameworks (14/42,33%), were most frequently used to guide adoption and evaluation strategies. Most studies (36/42, 86%) did not list the limitations associated with applying a specific theory, model, or framework. CONCLUSIONS: Models and related quality improvement methods were most frequently used to inform CDSS adoption. Models were not typically combined with each other or with theory to inform full-cycle implementation strategies. The findings highlight a gap in the application of implementation methods including theories, models, and frameworks to facilitate full-cycle implementation strategies for hospital CDSSs."
28915822,What hinders the uptake of computerized decision support systems in hospitals? A qualitative study and framework for implementation.,"BACKGROUND: Advanced Computerized Decision Support Systems (CDSSs) assist clinicians in their decision-making process, generating recommendations based on up-to-date scientific evidence. Although this technology has the potential to improve the quality of patient care, its mere provision does not guarantee uptake: even where CDSSs are available, clinicians often fail to adopt their recommendations. This study examines the barriers and facilitators to the uptake of an evidence-based CDSS as perceived by diverse health professionals in hospitals at different stages of CDSS adoption. METHODS: Qualitative study conducted as part of a series of randomized controlled trials of CDSSs. The sample includes two hospitals using a CDSS and two hospitals that aim to adopt a CDSS in the future. We interviewed physicians, nurses, information technology staff, and members of the boards of directors (n = 30). We used a constant comparative approach to develop a framework for guiding implementation. RESULTS: We identified six clusters of experiences of, and attitudes towards CDSSs, which we label as ""positions."" The six positions represent a gradient of acquisition of control over CDSSs (from low to high) and are characterized by different types of barriers to CDSS uptake. The most severe barriers (prevalent in the first positions) include clinicians' perception that the CDSSs may reduce their professional autonomy or may be used against them in the event of medical-legal controversies. Moving towards the last positions, these barriers are substituted by technical and usability problems related to the technology interface. When all barriers are overcome, CDSSs are perceived as a working tool at the service of its users, integrating clinicians' reasoning and fostering organizational learning. CONCLUSIONS: Barriers and facilitators to the use of CDSSs are dynamic and may exist prior to their introduction in clinical contexts; providing a static list of obstacles and facilitators, irrespective of the specific implementation phase and context, may not be sufficient or useful to facilitate uptake. Factors such as clinicians' attitudes towards scientific evidences and guidelines, the quality of inter-disciplinary relationships, and an organizational ethos of transparency and accountability need to be considered when exploring the readiness of a hospital to adopt CDSSs."
26306609,How to build up the actionable knowledge base: the role of 'best fit' framework synthesis for studies of improvement in healthcare.,"Increasing recognition of the role and value of theory in improvement work in healthcare offers the prospect of capitalising upon, and consolidating, actionable lessons from synthesis of improvement projects and initiatives. We propose that informed use of theory can (i) provide a mechanism by which to collect and organise data from a body of improvement work, (ii) offer a framework for analysis and identification of lessons learnt and (iii) facilitate an evaluation of the feasibility, effectiveness and acceptability of improvement programmes. Improvement practitioners can benefit from using an underpinning external structure as a lens by which to examine the specific achievements of their own projects alongside comparable initiatives led by others. We demonstrate the utility of a method known as 'best fit framework synthesis' (BFFS) in offering a ubiquitous and versatile means by which to collect, analyse and evaluate improvement work in healthcare. First reported in 2011, BFFS represents a pragmatic, flexible approach to integrating theory with findings from practice. A deductive phase, where a review team seeks to accommodate a substantial part of the data, is followed by an inductive phase, in which the team explores data not accommodated by the framework. We explore the potential for BFFS within improvement work by drawing upon the evidence synthesis methodology literature and practical examples of improvement work reported in BMJ Quality and Safety (2011-2015). We suggest four variants of BFFS that may have particular value in synthesising a body of improvement work. We conclude that BFFS, alongside other approaches that seek to optimise the contribution of theory to improvement work, represents one important enabling mechanism by which to establish the rigour and scientific credentials of the emerging discipline of 'improvement science'."
31225983,Conceptual Framework to Support Clinical Trial Optimization and End-to-End Enrollment Workflow.,"In this work, we present a conceptual framework to support clinical trial optimization and enrollment workflows and review the current state, limitations, and future trends in this space. This framework includes knowledge representation of clinical trials, clinical trial optimization, clinical trial design, enrollment workflows for prospective clinical trial matching, waitlist management, and, finally, evaluation strategies for assessing improvement."
37579360,"Impact of the Regulatory Framework on Medical Device Software Manufacturers: Are the Guidance Documents Supporting the Practical Implementation? Comment on ""Clinical Decision Support and New Regulatory Frameworks for Medical Devices: Are We Ready for It? - A Viewpoint Paper"".","The increasing use in clinical practice of software such as mobile apps and clinical decision support (CDS) software has only recently been taken up by regulators around the world. Specifically, the European Commission and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have updated their regulatory framework in the last years. Van Laere et al have given an extensive overview of the European and US approaches to regulate CDS software. This commentary further discusses regulatory differences between the two geographies and their impact on manufacturers of medical device software. We discuss the practical implementation of the regulatory framework for medical device software (especially CDS software) with a reference to the available international guidance documents and their limitations. Given the direction of stricter regulatory oversight in Europe, additional European guidelines/examples are desirable to enable a pragmatic regulatory approach ensuring continued access to innovative medical device software for European patients."
26628336,A prognostic model based on readily available clinical data enriched a pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing program.,"OBJECTIVES: We describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of a model to pre-emptively select patients for genotyping based on medication exposure risk. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Using deidentified electronic health records, we derived a prognostic model for the prescription of statins, warfarin, or clopidogrel. The model was implemented into a clinical decision support (CDS) tool to recommend pre-emptive genotyping for patients exceeding a prescription risk threshold. We evaluated the rule on an independent validation cohort and on an implementation cohort, representing the population in which the CDS tool was deployed. RESULTS: The model exhibited moderate discrimination with area under the receiver operator characteristic curves ranging from 0.68 to 0.75 at 1 and 2 years after index dates. Risk estimates tended to underestimate true risk. The cumulative incidences of medication prescriptions at 1 and 2 years were 0.35 and 0.48, respectively, among 1,673 patients flagged by the model. The cumulative incidences in the same number of randomly sampled subjects were 0.12 and 0.19, and in patients over 50 years with the highest body mass indices, they were 0.22 and 0.34. CONCLUSION: We demonstrate that prognostic algorithms can guide pre-emptive pharmacogenetic testing toward those likely to benefit from it."
27657685,Multidisciplinary model to implement pharmacogenomics at the point of care.,"PURPOSE: Despite potential clinical benefits, implementation of pharmacogenomics (PGx) faces many technical and clinical challenges. These challenges can be overcome with a comprehensive and systematic implementation model. METHODS: The development and implementation of PGx were organized into eight interdependent components addressing resources, governance, clinical practice, education, testing, knowledge translation, clinical decision support (CDS), and maintenance. Several aspects of implementation were assessed, including adherence to the model, production of PGx-CDS interventions, and access to educational resources. RESULTS: Between August 2012 and June 2015, 21 specific drug-gene interactions were reviewed and 18 of them were implemented in the electronic medical record as PGx-CDS interventions. There was complete adherence to the model with variable production time (98-392 days) and delay time (0-148 days). The implementation impacted approximately 1,247 unique providers and 3,788 unique patients. A total of 11 educational resources complementary to the drug-gene interactions and 5 modules specific for pharmacists were developed and implemented. CONCLUSION: A comprehensive operational model can support PGx implementation in routine prescribing. Institutions can use this model as a roadmap to support similar efforts. However, we also identified challenges that will require major multidisciplinary and multi-institutional efforts to make PGx a universal reality.Genet Med 19 4, 421-429."
34467776,Pharmacogenomic testing to support prescribing in primary care: a structured review of implementation models.,"The application of pharmacogenomics could meaningfully contribute toward medicines optimization within primary care. This review identified 13 studies describing eight implementation models utilizing a multi-gene pharmacogenomic panel within a primary care or community setting. These were small feasibility studies (n <200). They demonstrated importance and feasibility of pre-test counseling, the role of the pharmacist, data integration into the electronic medical record and point-of-care clinical decision support systems (CDSS). Findings were considered alongside existing primary care prescribing practices and implementation frameworks to demonstrate how issues may be addressed by existing nationalized healthcare and primary care infrastructure. Development of point-of-care CDSS should be prioritized; establishing clinical leadership, education programs, defining practitioner roles and responsibilities and addressing commissioning issues will also be crucial."
32046701,A comprehensive tool for creating and evaluating privacy-preserving biomedical prediction models.,"BACKGROUND: Modern data driven medical research promises to provide new insights into the development and course of disease and to enable novel methods of clinical decision support. To realize this, machine learning models can be trained to make predictions from clinical, paraclinical and biomolecular data. In this process, privacy protection and regulatory requirements need careful consideration, as the resulting models may leak sensitive personal information. To counter this threat, a wide range of methods for integrating machine learning with formal methods of privacy protection have been proposed. However, there is a significant lack of practical tools to create and evaluate such privacy-preserving models. In this software article, we report on our ongoing efforts to bridge this gap. RESULTS: We have extended the well-known ARX anonymization tool for biomedical data with machine learning techniques to support the creation of privacy-preserving prediction models. Our methods are particularly well suited for applications in biomedicine, as they preserve the truthfulness of data (e.g. no noise is added) and they are intuitive and relatively easy to explain to non-experts. Moreover, our implementation is highly versatile, as it supports binomial and multinomial target variables, different types of prediction models and a wide range of privacy protection techniques. All methods have been integrated into a sound framework that supports the creation, evaluation and refinement of models through intuitive graphical user interfaces. To demonstrate the broad applicability of our solution, we present three case studies in which we created and evaluated different types of privacy-preserving prediction models for breast cancer diagnosis, diagnosis of acute inflammation of the urinary system and prediction of the contraceptive method used by women. In this process, we also used a wide range of different privacy models (k-anonymity, differential privacy and a game-theoretic approach) as well as different data transformation techniques. CONCLUSIONS: With the tool presented in this article, accurate prediction models can be created that preserve the privacy of individuals represented in the training set in a variety of threat scenarios. Our implementation is available as open source software."
33731089,A systematic review of theoretical constructs in CDS literature.,"BACKGROUND: Studies that examine the adoption of clinical decision support (CDS) by healthcare providers have generally lacked a theoretical underpinning. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model may provide such a theory-based explanation; however, it is unknown if the model can be applied to the CDS literature. OBJECTIVE: Our overall goal was to develop a taxonomy based on UTAUT constructs that could reliably characterize CDS interventions. METHODS: We used a two-step process: (1) identified randomized controlled trials meeting comparative effectiveness criteria, e.g., evaluating the impact of CDS interventions with and without specific features or implementation strategies; (2) iteratively developed and validated a taxonomy for characterizing differential CDS features or implementation strategies using three raters. RESULTS: Twenty-five studies with 48 comparison arms were identified. We applied three constructs from the UTAUT model and added motivational control to characterize CDS interventions. Inter-rater reliability was as follows for model constructs: performance expectancy (kappa = 0.79), effort expectancy (kappa = 0.85), social influence (kappa = 0.71), and motivational control (kappa = 0.87). CONCLUSION: We found that constructs from the UTAUT model and motivational control can reliably characterize features and associated implementation strategies. Our next step is to examine the quantitative relationships between constructs and CDS adoption."
31466526,"Implementing cardiovascular disease prevention guidelines to translate evidence-based medicine and shared decision making into general practice: theory-based intervention development, qualitative piloting and quantitative feasibility.","BACKGROUND: The use of cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention guidelines based on absolute risk assessment is poor around the world, including Australia. Behavioural barriers amongst GPs and patients include capability (e.g. difficulty communicating/understanding risk) and motivation (e.g. attitudes towards guidelines/medication). This paper outlines the theory-based development of a website for GP guidelines, and piloting of a new risk calculator/decision aid. METHODS: Stage 1 involved identifying evidence-based solutions using the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework, informed by previous research involving 400 GPs and 600 patients/consumers. Stage 2 co-developed website content with GPs. Stage 3 piloted a prototype website at a national GP conference. Stage 4 iteratively improved the website based on ""think aloud"" interviews with GPs and patients. Stage 5 was a feasibility study to evaluate potential efficacy (guidelines-based recommendations for each risk category), acceptability (intended use) and demand (actual use over 1 month) amongst GPs (n = 98). RESULTS: Stage 1 identified GPs as the target for behaviour change; the need for a new risk calculator/decision aid linked to existing audit and feedback training; and online guidelines as a delivery format. Stage 2-4 iteratively improved content and format based on qualitative feedback from GP and patient user testing over three rounds of website development. Stage 5 suggested potential efficacy with improved identification of hypothetical high risk patients (from 26 to 76%) and recommended medication (from 57 to 86%) after viewing the website (n = 42), but prescribing to low risk patients remained similar (from 19 to 22%; n = 37). Most GPs (89%) indicated they would use the website in the next month, and 72% reported using it again after one month (n = 98). Open feedback identified implementation barriers including a need for integration with medical software, low health literacy resources and pre-consultation assessment. CONCLUSIONS: Following a theory-based development process and user co-design, the resulting intervention was acceptable to GPs with high intentions for use, improved identification of patient risk categories and more guidelines-based prescribing intentions for high risk but not low risk patients. The effectiveness of linking the intervention to clinical practice more closely to address implementation barriers will be evaluated in future research."
30815062,"The Impact of an Enterprise Electronic Medical Record (EEMR) Model vs a Clinical Information System (CIS) Model on Usability, Efficiency, and Adaptability.","This paper describes a methodology that engages the clinical community into the design process of creating Clinical Information Systems (CISs) under a Clinical Team-Led Design (CTLD) approach in the context of using Immediately Adaptable (IA) system development technology. The methodology is contrasted against the Enterprise Electronic Medical Record (EEMR) model for usability, efficiency, and adaptability. The methodology was tested in a Breast Cancer setting where the CIS went through 4 rapid agile stages. Time and motion statistics, training times, system changes, and user feedback data was collected for assessment. The results showed that the Breast CIS increased time efficiency by 30% in the first 3 months of implementation. Users reported high usability and trainability of the system. Over 95% of system design change requests were satisfied with an average turn-around time of 3 days. The results show that systems designed under a CTLD approach, accompanied by Immediately Adaptable system architecture, provide greater efficiency for staff in clinical settings while enabling the workflow processes to be adapted dynamically as part of continuous process improvement."
38311011,Clinical decision support systems for multidisciplinary team decision-making in patients with solid cancer: Composition of an implementation model based on a scoping review.,"Generating guideline-based recommendations during multidisciplinary team (MDT) meetings in solid cancers is getting more complex due to increasing amount of information needed to follow the guidelines. Usage of clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) can simplify and optimize decision-making. However, CDSS implementation is lagging behind. Therefore, we aim to compose a CDSS implementation model. By performing a scoping review of the currently reported CDSSs for MDT decision-making we determined 102 barriers and 86 facilitators for CDSS implementation out of 44 papers describing 20 different CDSSs. The most frequently reported barriers and facilitators for CDSS implementation supporting MDT decision-making concerned CDSS maintenance (e.g. incorporating guideline updates), validity of recommendations and interoperability with electronic health records. Based on the identified barriers and facilitators, we composed a CDSS implementation model describing clinical utility, analytic validity and clinical validity to guide CDSS integration more successfully in the clinical workflow to support MDTs in the future."
28689924,A national framework for an antimicrobial resistance surveillance system within Iranian healthcare facilities: Towards a global surveillance system.,"OBJECTIVES: The threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is growing rapidly, perhaps more dramatically in developing countries. A demand to monitor, surveil and predict AMR has prompted the design and implementation of AMR surveillance systems (AMRSSs) at all geographic levels, especially in the national context. This study reviewed AMRSSs in leading countries and organisations in order to customise a comprehensive framework for a national system in Iran. METHODS: The research was conducted in two phases: a review of the literature and comparative analysis; and a knowledge, attitude and practice study. In the first phase, the AMRSSs of pioneering organisations and countries were reviewed by examining related documents. In the second phase, important components for the Iranian national system were determined on the basis of the World Health Organization's Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (WHO GLASS). RESULTS: This study determined the surveillance methods, priority specimens and pathogens, testing methods, reporting protocols and scheduling, recommended data sets, and tools and information flow necessary for the Iranian system. On this basis, a national framework was developed using the class and activity diagrams in Unified Modelling Language. A context diagram was also designed on the basis of a generic biosurveillance architecture. CONCLUSIONS: The design and implementation of a national AMRSS for Iranian healthcare facilities is critically required because of irrational antimicrobial use in Iran and insufficient data regarding its consequences."
31129567,A unique framework for the Persian clinical guidelines: addressing an evidence-based CDSS development need.,"BACKGROUND AND AIM: One of the prerequisites to develop Computerised Decision Support Systems is Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) which provide a systematic aid to make complex medical decisions. In order to provide an automated CPG, it is needed to have a unique structure for the CPGs. This study aims to propose a unique framework for the Persian guidelines. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 20 Persian CPGs were selected and divided into the creation and validation sets (n=10 for each). The first group was studied independently and their headings were listed; wherever possible, the headings were merged into a new heading that was applicable to all the guidelines. The developed framework was validated by the second group of the guidelines. RESULTS: Studied guidelines had a very heterogeneous structure. The number of original headings was 249; they were reduced to 14 main headings with 16 subheadings in a unique developed framework. The framework is able to represent and cover 100% of the guidelines. CONCLUSION: The heterogeneity of guidelines was high as they were not developed based on the unique framework. The proposed framework provides a layout for designing the CPGs with a homogeneous structure. Guideline developers can use this framework to develop structured CPGs. This will facilitate the integration of the guidelines into electronic medical records as well as clinical decision support systems."
35606762,Improving care for hypertension and diabetes in india by addition of clinical decision support system and task shifting in the national NCD program: I-TREC model of care.,"BACKGROUND: The growing burden of hypertension and diabetes is one of the major public health challenges being faced by the health system in India. Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) that assist with tailoring evidence-based management approaches combined with task-shifting from more specialized to less specialized providers may together enhance the impact of a program. We sought to integrate a technology ""CDSS"" and a strategy ""Task-shifting"" within the Government of India's (GoI) Non-Communicable Diseases (NCD) System under the Comprehensive Primary Health Care (CPHC) initiative to enhance the program's impact to address the growing burden of hypertension and diabetes in India. METHODS: We developed a model of care ""I-TREC"" entirely calibrated for implementation within the current health system across all facility types (Primary Health Centre, Community Health Centre, and District Hospital) in a block in Shaheed Bhagat Singh (SBS) Nagar district of Punjab, India. We undertook an academic-community partnership to incorporate the combination of a CDSS with task-shifting into the GoI CPHC-NCD system, a platform that assists healthcare providers to record patient information for routine NCD care. Academic partners developed clinical algorithms, a revised clinic workflow, and provider training modules with iterative collaboration and consultation with government and technology partners to incorporate CDSS within the existing system. DISCUSSION: The CDSS-enabled GoI CPHC-NCD system provides evidence-based recommendations for hypertension and diabetes; threshold-based prompts to assure referral mechanism across health facilities; integrated patient database, and care coordination through workflow management and dashboard alerts. To enable efficient implementation, modifications were made in the patient workflow and the fulcrum of the use of technology shifted from physician to nurse. CONCLUSION: Designed to be applicable nationwide, the I-TREC model of care is being piloted in a block in the state of Punjab, India. Learnings from I-TREC will provide a roadmap to other public health experts to integrate and adapt their interventions at the national level. TRIAL REGISTRATION: CTRI/2020/01/022723."
29875427,"Implementation, adoption, and utility of family health history risk assessment in diverse care settings: evaluating implementation processes and impact with an implementation framework.","PURPOSE: This paper describes the implementation outcomes associated with integrating a family health history-based risk assessment and clinical decision support platform within primary care clinics at four diverse healthcare systems. METHODS: A type III hybrid implementation-effectiveness trial. Uptake and implementation processes were evaluated using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. RESULTS: One hundred (58%) primary care providers and 2514 (7.8%) adult patients enrolled. Enrolled patients were 69% female, 22% minority, and 32% Medicare/Medicaid. Compared with their respective clinic's population, patient-participants were more likely to be female (69 vs. 59%), older (mean age 57 vs. 49), and Caucasian (88 vs. 69%) (all p values <0.001). Female (81.3% of females vs. 78.5% of males, p value = 0.018) and Caucasian (Caucasians 90.4% vs. minority 84.1%, p value = 0.02) patient-participants were more likely to complete the study once enrolled. Patient-participant survey responses indicated MeTree was easy to use (95%), and patient-participants would recommend it to family/friends (91%). Minorities and those with less education reported greatest benefit. Enrolled providers reflected demographics of underlying provider population. CONCLUSION: Family health history-based risk assessment can be effectively implemented in diverse primary care settings and can effectively engage patients and providers. Future research should focus on finding better ways to engage young adults, males, and minorities in preventive healthcare."
33030437,Barriers and Enablers to Using a Patient-Facing Electronic Questionnaire: A Qualitative Theoretical Domains Framework Analysis.,"BACKGROUND: Electronic patient questionnaires are becoming ubiquitous in health care. To address care gaps that contribute to poor asthma management, we developed the Electronic Asthma Management System, which includes a previsit electronic patient questionnaire linked to a computerized clinical decision support system. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to identify the determinants (barriers and enablers) of patient uptake and completion of a previsit mobile health questionnaire. METHODS: We conducted semistructured interviews with adult patients with asthma in Toronto, Canada. After demonstrating the questionnaire, participants completed the questionnaire using their smartphones and were then interviewed regarding perceived barriers and enablers to using and completing the questionnaire. Interview questions were based on the Theoretical Domains Framework to identify the determinants of health-related behavior. We generated themes that addressed the enablers and barriers to the uptake and completion of the questionnaire. RESULTS: In total, 12 participants were interviewed for saturation. Key enablers were as follows: the questionnaire was easy to complete without additional knowledge or skills and was perceived as a priority and responsibility for patients, use could lead to more efficient and personalized care, completion on one's own time would be convenient, and uptake and completion could be optimized through patient reminders. Concerns about data security, the usefulness of questionnaire data, the stress of completing it accurately and on time, competing priorities, and preferences to complete the questionnaire on other devices were the main barriers. CONCLUSIONS: The barriers and enablers identified by patients should be addressed by developing implementation strategies to enhance e-questionnaire use and completion by patients. As the use of e-questionnaires grows, our findings will contribute to implementation efforts across settings and diseases."
29854232,Modeling Contextual Knowledge for Clinical Decision Support.,"In theory, the logic of decision rules should be atomic. In practice, this is not always possible; initially simple logic statements tend to be overloaded with additional conditions restricting the scope of such rules. By doing so, the original logic soon becomes encumbered with contextual knowledge. Contextual knowledge is re-usable on its own and could be modeled separately from the logic of a rule without losing the intended functionality. We model constraints to explicitly define the context where knowledge of decision rules is actionable. We borrowed concepts from Semantic Web, Complex Adaptive Systems, and Contextual Reasoning. The proposed approach provides the means for identifying and modeling contextual knowledge in a simple, sound manner. The methodology presented herein facilitates rule authoring, fosters consistency in rules implementation and maintenance; facilitates developing authoritative knowledge repositories to promote quality, safety and efficacy of healthcare; and paves the road for future work in knowledge discovery."
29854164,Thinking Together: Modeling Clinical Decision-Support as a Sociotechnical System.,"Computerized clinical decision-support systems are members of larger sociotechnical systems, composed of human and automated actors, who send, receive, and manipulate artifacts. Sociotechnical consideration is rare in the literature. This makes it difficult to comparatively evaluate the success of CDS implementations, and it may also indicate that sociotechnical context receives inadequate consideration in practice. To facilitate sociotechnical consideration, we developed the Thinking Together model, a flexible diagrammatical means of representing CDS systems as sociotechnical systems. To develop this model, we examined the literature with the lens of Distributed Cognition (DCog) theory. We then present two case studies of vastly different CDSSs, one almost fully automated and the other with minimal automation, to illustrate the flexibility of the Thinking Together model. We show that this model, informed by DCog and the CDS literature, are capable of supporting both research, by enabling comparative evaluation, and practice, by facilitating explicit sociotechnical planning and communication."
35657475,Clinical decision support models for oropharyngeal cancer treatment: design and evaluation of a multi-stage knowledge abstraction and formalization process.,"PURPOSE: Treatment decisions in oncology are demanding and affect survival, general health, and quality of life. Expert systems can handle the complexity of the oncological field. We propose the application of a hybrid modeling approach for decision support models consisting of expert-based implementation of a decision model structure and machine-learning (ML) based parameter generation. We demonstrate our approach for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. METHODS: We created a clinical decision model based on Bayesian Networks and iteratively optimized its characteristics using structured knowledge engineering approaches. We combined manual adaptation of individual concepts with automatic learning of parameters and causalities. Using data from 94 patient records, we targeted the needed objectivity and clinical significance. RESULTS: In three iteration steps, we assessed the model with cross-validations. The initial aggregated accuracy of 0.529 could be increased to 0.883 in the final version. The predictive rates of the target nodes range from 0.557 to 0.960. CONCLUSION: Combining different methodological approaches requires balancing the complexity of the clinical subject matter with the amount of information available in the dataset for ML application. Our method showed promising results because flaws of one approach can be overcome by the other approach. However, technical integrability as well as clinical acceptance must always be ensured."
32499009,Modeling and processing up-to-dateness of patient information in probabilistic therapy decision support.,"OBJECTIVES: Probabilistic modeling of a patient's situation with the goal of providing calculated therapy recommendations can improve the decision making of interdisciplinary teams. Relevant information entities and direct causal dependencies, as well as uncertainty, must be formally described. Possible therapy options, tailored to the patient, can be inferred from the clinical data using these descriptions. However, there are several avoidable factors of uncertainty influencing the accuracy of the inference. For instance, inaccuracy may emerge from outdated information. In general, probabilistic models, e.g. Bayesian Networks can depict the causality and relations of individual information entities, but in general cannot evaluate individual entities concerning their up-to-dateness. The goal of the work at hand is to model diagnostic up-to-dateness, which can reasonably adjust the influence of outdated diagnostic information to improve the inference results of clinical decision models. METHODS AND MATERIALS: We analyzed 68 laryngeal cancer cases and modeled the state of up-to-dateness of different diagnostic modalities. All cases were used for cross-validation. 55 cases were used to train the model, 13 for testing. Each diagnostic procedure involved in the decision making process of these cases was associated with a specific threshold for the time the information is considered up-to-date, i.e. reliable. Based on this threshold, outdated findings could be identified and their impact on probabilistic calculations could be reduced. We applied the model for reducing the weight of outdated patient data in the computation of TNM stagings for the 13 test cases and compared the results to the manually derived TNM stagings in the patient files. RESULTS: With the implementation of these weights in the laryngeal cancer model, we increased the accuracy of the TNM calculation from 0.61 (8 out of 13 cases correct) to 0.76 (10 out of 13 cases correct). CONCLUSION: Decision delay may cause specific patient data to be outdated. This can cause contradictory or false information and impair calculations for clinical decision support. Our approach demonstrates that the accuracy of Bayesian Network models can be improved when pre-processing the patient-specific data and evaluating their up-to-dateness with reduced weights on outdated information."
31419982,What do healthcare professionals need to turn risk models for type 2 diabetes into usable computerized clinical decision support systems? Lessons learned from the MOSAIC project.,"BACKGROUND: To understand user needs, system requirements and organizational conditions towards successful design and adoption of Clinical Decision Support Systems for Type 2 Diabetes (T2D) care built on top of computerized risk models. METHODS: The holistic and evidence-based CEHRES Roadmap, used to create eHealth solutions through participatory development approach, persuasive design techniques and business modelling, was adopted in the MOSAIC project to define the sequence of multidisciplinary methods organized in three phases, user needs, implementation and evaluation. The research was qualitative, the total number of participants was ninety, about five-seventeen involved in each round of experiment. RESULTS: Prediction models for the onset of T2D are built on clinical studies, while for T2D care are derived from healthcare registries. Accordingly, two set of DSSs were defined: the first, T2D Screening, introduces a novel routine; in the second case, T2D Care, DSSs can support managers at population level, and daily practitioners at individual level. In the user needs phase, T2D Screening and solution T2D Care at population level share similar priorities, as both deal with risk-stratification. End-users of T2D Screening and solution T2D Care at individual level prioritize easiness of use and satisfaction, while managers prefer the tools to be available every time and everywhere. In the implementation phase, three Use Cases were defined for T2D Screening, adapting the tool to different settings and granularity of information. Two Use Cases were defined around solutions T2D Care at population and T2D Care at individual, to be used in primary or secondary care. Suitable filtering options were equipped with ""attractive"" visual analytics to focus the attention of end-users on specific parameters and events. In the evaluation phase, good levels of user experience versus bad level of usability suggest that end-users of T2D Screening perceived the potential, but they are worried about complexity. Usability and user experience were above acceptable thresholds for T2D Care at population and T2D Care at individual. CONCLUSIONS: By using a holistic approach, we have been able to understand user needs, behaviours and interactions and give new insights in the definition of effective Decision Support Systems to deal with the complexity of T2D care."
35986284,Acceptance of clinical decision support system to prevent venous thromboembolism among nurses: an extension of the UTAUT model.,"BACKGROUND: Venous thromboembolism has been a major public health problem and caused a heavy disease burden. Venous thromboembolism clinical decision support system was proved to have a positive influence on the prevention and management of venous thromboembolism. As the direct users, nurses' acceptance of this system is of great importance to support the successful implementation of it. However, there are few relevant studies to investigate nurses' acceptance and the associated factors are still unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the determinant factors of nurses' acceptance of venous thromboembolism clinical decision support system with the modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. METHODS: We designed a questionnaire based on the modified Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and then a cross-sectional survey was conducted among nurses in a tertiary hospital in Nanjing, China. Statistically, a Structural Equation Modeling -Partial Least Squares path modeling approach was applied to examine the research model. RESULTS: A total of 1100 valid questionnaires were recycled. The modified model explained 74.7%, 83.0% and 86% of the variance in user satisfaction, behavioral intention and user behavior, respectively. The results showed that performance expectancy (beta = 0.254, p = 0.000), social influence (beta = 0.136, p = 0.047), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.245, p = 0.000), self-efficacy (beta = 0.121, p = 0.048) and user satisfaction (beta = 0.193, p = 0.001) all had significant effects on nurses' intention. Although effort expectancy (beta = 0.010, p = 0.785) did not have a direct effect on nurses' intention, it could indirectly influence nurses' intention with user satisfaction as the mediator (beta = 0.296, p = 0.000). User behavior was significantly predicted by facilitating conditions (beta = 0.298, p = 0.000) and user intention (beta = 0.654, p = 0.001). CONCLUSION: The research enhances our understanding of the determinants of nurses' acceptance of venous thromboembolism clinical decision support system. Among these factors, performance expectancy was considered as the top priority. It highlights the importance of optimizing system performance to fit the users' needs. Generally, the findings in our research provide clinical technology designers and administrators with valuable information to better meet users' requirements and promote the implementation of venous thromboembolism clinical decision support system."
31630113,Using normalisation process theory to understand workflow implications of decision support implementation across diverse primary care settings.,"BACKGROUND: Effective implementation of technologies into clinical workflow is hampered by lack of integration into daily activities. Normalisation process theory (NPT) can be used to describe the kinds of 'work' necessary to implement and embed complex new practices. We determined the suitability of NPT to assess the facilitators, barriers and 'work' of implementation of two clinical decision support (CDS) tools across diverse care settings. METHODS: We conducted baseline and 6-month follow-up quantitative surveys of clinic leadership at two academic institutions' primary care clinics randomised to the intervention arm of a larger study. The survey was adapted from the NPT toolkit, analysing four implementation domains: sense-making, participation, action, monitoring. Domains were summarised among completed responses (n=60) and examined by role, institution, and time. RESULTS: The median score for each NPT domain was the same across roles and institutions at baseline, and decreased at 6 months. At 6 months, clinic managers' participation domain (p=0.003), and all domains for medical directors (p<0.003) declined. At 6 months, the action domain decreased among Utah respondents (p=0.03), and all domains decreased among Wisconsin respondents (p</=0.008). CONCLUSIONS: This study employed NPT to longitudinally assess the implementation barriers of new CDS. The consistency of results across participant roles suggests similarities in the work each role took on during implementation. The decline in engagement over time suggests the need for more frequent contact to maintain momentum. Using NPT to evaluate this implementation provides insight into domains which can be addressed with participants to improve success of new electronic health record technologies.

31831546,Acute kidney injury electronic alerts: mixed methods Normalisation Process Theory evaluation of their implementation into secondary care in England.,"OBJECTIVE: Around one in five emergency hospital admissions are affected by acute kidney injury (AKI). To address poor quality of care in relation to AKI, electronic alerts (e-alerts) are mandated across primary and secondary care in England and Wales. Evidence of the benefit of AKI e-alerts remains conflicting, with at least some uncertainty explained by poor or unclear implementation. The objective of this study was to identify factors relating to implementation, using Normalisation Process Theory (NPT), which promote or inhibit use of AKI e-alerts in secondary care. DESIGN: Mixed methods combining qualitative (observations, semi-structured interviews) and quantitative (survey) methods. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Three secondary care hospitals in North East England, representing two distinct AKI e-alerting systems. Observations (>44 hours) were conducted in Emergency Assessment Units (EAUs). Semi-structured interviews were conducted with clinicians (n=29) from EAUs, vascular or general surgery or care of the elderly. Qualitative data were supplemented by Normalization MeAsure Development (NoMAD) surveys (n=101). ANALYSIS: Qualitative data were analysed using the NPT framework, with quantitative data analysed descriptively and using chi(2) and Wilcoxon signed-rank test for differences in current and future normalisation. RESULTS: Participants reported familiarity with the AKI e-alerts but that the e-alerts would become more normalised in the future (p<0.001). No single NPT mechanism led to current (un)successful implementation of the e-alerts, but analysis of the underlying subconstructs identified several mechanisms indicative of successful normalisation (internalisation, legitimation) or unsuccessful normalisation (initiation, differentiation, skill set workability, systematisation). CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians recognised the value and importance of AKI e-alerts in their practice, although this was not sufficient for the e-alerts to be routinely engaged with by clinicians. To further normalise the use of AKI e-alerts, there is a need for tailored training on use of the e-alerts and routine feedback to clinicians on the impact that e-alerts have on patient outcomes."
37105697,Using sociotechnical theory to understand medication safety work in primary care and prescribers' use of clinical decision support: a qualitative study.,"OBJECTIVES: The concept of safety work draws attention to the intentional work of ensuring safety within care systems. Clinical decision support (CDS) has been designed to enhance medication safety in primary care by providing decision-making support to prescribers. Sociotechnical theory understands that healthcare settings are complex and dynamically connected systems of fluid networks, human agents, changing relationships and social processes. This study aimed to understand the relationship between safety work and the use of CDS. DESIGN AND SETTING: This qualitative study took place across nine different general practices in England. Stakeholders included general practitioners (GPs) and general practice-based pharmacists and nurse prescribers. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to illicit how the system was used by the participants in the context of medication safety work. Data analysis conducted alongside data collection was thematic and drew on socio-technical theory. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-three interviews were conducted with 14 GPs, three nurse prescribers and three practice pharmacists between February 2018 and June 2020. RESULTS: Safety work was contextually situated in a complex network of relationships. Three interconnected themes were interpreted from the data: (1) the use of CDS within organisational and social practices and workflows; (2) safety work and the use of CDS within the interplay between prescribers, patients and populations; and (3) the affordances embedded in CDS systems. CONCLUSION: The use of sociotechnical theory here extends current thinking in patient safety particularly in the ways that safety work was co-constituted with the use of CDS alerts. This has implications for implementation and use to ensure that the contexts into which such CDS systems are implemented are taken into account. Understanding how alerts can adapt safety culture will help improve the efficacy of CDS systems, enhance prescribing safety and help to further understand how safety work is achieved in primary care."
31621071,Development and Implementation of Electronic Health Record-Integrated Model-Informed Clinical Decision Support Tools for the Precision Dosing of Drugs.,"Imagine it is 2030, and the drug label is in the cloud, is interactive, and can provide model-informed precision dosing support based on an individual's genomic and physiologic makeup that is uploaded via a user-friendly interface. Precision medicine has vastly improved our ability to provide tailored therapeutics, and groundbreaking advances in noninvasive systems have generated smart wearable devices that can follow our physiologic state and drug exposure in real time. One device consists of a microfluidic drug biosensor with a transmitter attached to the skin and a mobile app that displays concentration values and trends while issuing alerts and providing suggestions on dose changes when out of range. This sounds compelling, but why has model-informed precision dosing not yet become common clinical reality in 2020?"
28859829,Multi-model-based interactive authoring environment for creating shareable medical knowledge.,"OBJECTIVE: Technologically integrated healthcare environments can be realized if physicians are encouraged to use smart systems for the creation and sharing of knowledge used in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). While CDSSs are heading toward smart environments, they lack support for abstraction of technology-oriented knowledge from physicians. Therefore, abstraction in the form of a user-friendly and flexible authoring environment is required in order for physicians to create shareable and interoperable knowledge for CDSS workflows. Our proposed system provides a user-friendly authoring environment to create Arden Syntax MLM (Medical Logic Module) as shareable knowledge rules for intelligent decision-making by CDSS. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Existing systems are not physician friendly and lack interoperability and shareability of knowledge. In this paper, we proposed Intelligent-Knowledge Authoring Tool (I-KAT), a knowledge authoring environment that overcomes the above mentioned limitations. Shareability is achieved by creating a knowledge base from MLMs using Arden Syntax. Interoperability is enhanced using standard data models and terminologies. However, creation of shareable and interoperable knowledge using Arden Syntax without abstraction increases complexity, which ultimately makes it difficult for physicians to use the authoring environment. Therefore, physician friendliness is provided by abstraction at the application layer to reduce complexity. This abstraction is regulated by mappings created between legacy system concepts, which are modeled as domain clinical model (DCM) and decision support standards such as virtual medical record (vMR) and Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine - Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). We represent these mappings with a semantic reconciliation model (SRM). RESULTS: The objective of the study is the creation of shareable and interoperable knowledge using a user-friendly and flexible I-KAT. Therefore we evaluated our system using completeness and user satisfaction criteria, which we assessed through the system- and user-centric evaluation processes. For system-centric evaluation, we compared the implementation of clinical information modelling system requirements in our proposed system and in existing systems. The results suggested that 82.05% of the requirements were fully supported, 7.69% were partially supported, and 10.25% were not supported by our system. In the existing systems, 35.89% of requirements were fully supported, 28.20% were partially supported, and 35.89% were not supported. For user-centric evaluation, the assessment criterion was 'ease of use'. Our proposed system showed 15 times better results with respect to MLM creation time than the existing systems. Moreover, on average, the participants made only one error in MLM creation using our proposed system, but 13 errors per MLM using the existing systems. CONCLUSION: We provide a user-friendly authoring environment for creation of shareable and interoperable knowledge for CDSS to overcome knowledge acquisition complexity. The authoring environment uses state-of-the-art decision support-related clinical standards with increased ease of use."
27577430,Design of a Fine-Grained Knowledge Model for the Formalization of Clinical Practice Guidelines: Comparison with GEM.,"Published as textual documents, clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) didn't demonstrate to impact physician practices when disseminated in their original format. However, when computerized and embedded in clinical decision support systems, they appeared to be more effective. In order to ease the translation from textual to computerized CPGs, we have elaborated a fine-grained knowledge model of CPGs (FGKM) to be used when authoring CPGs. The work has been conducted on VIDALRecos(R) CPGs. The building of the model has followed a bottom-up iterative process starting with 15 different CPGs. The first version of the FGKM has been assessed on two new complex CPGs, and was enriched by comparison with the Guideline Elements Model (GEM). The final version of the FGKM has been tested on the 2014 Hypertension CPGs. We compared the rules automatically derived from FGKM instances to those manually extracted from textual CPGs for decision support. Results showed that difficulties such as text normalization have to be solved. The FGKM is intended to be used upstream of the process of CPGs authoring in order to ease the implementation and the update of both textual and computerized CPGs."
29973225,Implementation and use of computerised clinical decision support (CCDS) in emergency pre-hospital care: a qualitative study of paramedic views and experience using Strong Structuration Theory.,"BACKGROUND: Computerised clinical decision support (CCDS) has been shown to improve processes of care in some healthcare settings, but there is little evidence related to its use or effects in pre-hospital emergency care. CCDS in this setting aligns with policies to increase IT use in ambulance care, enhance paramedic decision-making skills, reduce avoidable emergency department attendances and improve quality of care and patient experience. This qualitative study was conducted alongside a cluster randomised trial in two ambulance services of the costs and effects of web-based CCDS system designed to support paramedic decision-making in the care of older people following a fall. Paramedics were trained to enter observations and history for relevant patients on a tablet, and the CCDS then generated a recommended course of action which could be logged. Our aim was to describe paramedics' experience of the CCDS intervention and to identify factors affecting its implementation and use. METHODS: We invited all paramedics who had been randomly allocated to the intervention arm of the trial to participate in interviews or focus groups. The study was underpinned by Strong Structuration Theory, a theoretical model for studying innovation based on the relationship between what people do and their context. We used the Framework approach to data analysis. RESULTS: Twenty out of 22 paramedics agreed to participate. We developed a model of paramedic experience of CCDS with three domains: context, adoption and use, and outcomes. Aspects of context which had an impact included organisational culture and perceived support for non-conveyance decisions. Experience of adoption and use of the CCDS varied between individual paramedics, with some using it with all eligible patients, some only with patients they thought were 'suitable' and some never using it. A range of outcomes were reported, some of which were different from the intended role of the technology in decision support. CONCLUSION: Implementation of new technology such as CCDS is not a one-off event, but an ongoing process, which requires support at the organisational level to be effective.

30419934,"What drives adoption of a computerised, multifaceted quality improvement intervention for cardiovascular disease management in primary healthcare settings? A mixed methods analysis using normalisation process theory.","BACKGROUND: A computerised, multifaceted quality improvement (QI) intervention for cardiovascular disease (CVD) management in Australian primary healthcare was evaluated in a cluster randomised controlled trial. The intervention was associated with improved CVD risk factor screening but there was no improvement in prescribing rates of guideline-recommended medicines. The aim of this study was to conduct a process evaluation to identify and explain the underlying mechanisms by which the intervention did and did not have an impact. METHODS/DESIGN: Normalisation process theory (NPT) was used to understand factors that supported or constrained normalisation of the intervention into routine practice. A case study design was used in which six of the 30 participating intervention sites were purposively sampled to obtain a mix of size, governance, structure and performance. Multiple data sources were drawn on including trial outcome data, surveys of job satisfaction and team climate (68 staff) and in-depth interviews (19 staff). Data were primarily analysed within cases and compared with quantitative findings in other trial intervention and usual care sites. RESULTS: We found a complex interaction between implementation processes and several contextual factors affecting uptake of the intervention. There was no clear association between team climate, job satisfaction and intervention outcomes. There were four spheres of influence that appeared to enhance or detract from normalisation of the intervention: organisational mission and history (e.g. strategic investment to promote a QI culture enhanced cognitive participation), leadership (e.g. ability to energise or demotivate others influenced coherence), team environment (e.g. synergistic activities of team members with different skill sets influenced collective action) and technical integrity of the intervention (e.g. tools that slowed computer systems limited reflective action). DISCUSSION: Use of NPT helped explain how certain contextual factors influence the work that is done by individuals and teams when implementing a novel intervention. Although these factors do not necessarily distil into a recipe for successful uptake, they may assist system planners, intervention developers, and health professionals to better understand the trajectory that primary health care services may take when developing and engaging with QI interventions.

31055764,"Extending BPMN 2.0 for intraoperative workflow modeling with IEEE 11073 SDC for description and orchestration of interoperable, networked medical devices.","PURPOSE: Surgical workflow management in integrated operating rooms (ORs) enables the implementation of novel computer-aided surgical assistance and new applications in process automation, situation awareness, and decision support. The context-sensitive configuration and orchestration of interoperable, networked medical devices is a prerequisite for an effective reduction in the surgeons' workload, by providing the right service and right information at the right time. The information about the surgical situation must be described as surgical process models and distributed to the medical devices and IT systems in the OR. Available modeling languages are not capable of describing surgical processes for this application. METHODS: In this work, the BPMN(SIX) modeling language for intraoperative processes is technically enhanced and implemented for workflow build-time and run-time. Therefore, particular attention is given to the integration of the recently published IEEE 11073 SDC standard family for a service-oriented architecture of networked medical devices. In addition, interaction patterns for context-aware configuration and device orchestration were presented. RESULTS: The identified interaction patterns were implemented in BPMN(SIX) for an ophthalmologic use case. Therefore, the examples of the process-driven incorporation and control of device services could be demonstrated. CONCLUSION: The modeling of surgical procedures with BPMN(SIX) allows the implementation of context-sensitive surgical assistance functionalities and enables flexibility in terms of the orchestration of dynamically changing device ensembles and integration of unknown devices in the surgical workflow management."
26159465,WebDISCO: a web service for distributed cox model learning without patient-level data sharing.,"OBJECTIVE: The Cox proportional hazards model is a widely used method for analyzing survival data. To achieve sufficient statistical power in a survival analysis, it usually requires a large amount of data. Data sharing across institutions could be a potential workaround for providing this added power. METHODS AND MATERIALS: The authors develop a web service for distributed Cox model learning (WebDISCO), which focuses on the proof-of-concept and algorithm development for federated survival analysis. The sensitive patient-level data can be processed locally and only the less-sensitive intermediate statistics are exchanged to build a global Cox model. Mathematical derivation shows that the proposed distributed algorithm is identical to the centralized Cox model. RESULTS: The authors evaluated the proposed framework at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD), Emory, and Duke. The experimental results show that both distributed and centralized models result in near-identical model coefficients with differences in the range [Formula: see text] to [Formula: see text]. The results confirm the mathematical derivation and show that the implementation of the distributed model can achieve the same results as the centralized implementation. LIMITATION: The proposed method serves as a proof of concept, in which a publicly available dataset was used to evaluate the performance. The authors do not intend to suggest that this method can resolve policy and engineering issues related to the federated use of institutional data, but they should serve as evidence of the technical feasibility of the proposed approach.Conclusions WebDISCO (Web-based Distributed Cox Regression Model; https://webdisco.ucsd-dbmi.org:8443/cox/) provides a proof-of-concept web service that implements a distributed algorithm to conduct distributed survival analysis without sharing patient level data."
27655861,Predicting inpatient clinical order patterns with probabilistic topic models vs conventional order sets.,"OBJECTIVE: Build probabilistic topic model representations of hospital admissions processes and compare the ability of such models to predict clinical order patterns as compared to preconstructed order sets. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The authors evaluated the first 24 hours of structured electronic health record data for > 10 K inpatients. Drawing an analogy between structured items (e.g., clinical orders) to words in a text document, the authors performed latent Dirichlet allocation probabilistic topic modeling. These topic models use initial clinical information to predict clinical orders for a separate validation set of > 4 K patients. The authors evaluated these topic model-based predictions vs existing human-authored order sets by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, precision, and recall for subsequent clinical orders. RESULTS: Existing order sets predict clinical orders used within 24 hours with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.81, precision 16%, and recall 35%. This can be improved to 0.90, 24%, and 47% ( P  < 10 -20 ) by using probabilistic topic models to summarize clinical data into up to 32 topics. Many of these latent topics yield natural clinical interpretations (e.g., ""critical care,"" ""pneumonia,"" ""neurologic evaluation""). DISCUSSION: Existing order sets tend to provide nonspecific, process-oriented aid, with usability limitations impairing more precise, patient-focused support. Algorithmic summarization has the potential to breach this usability barrier by automatically inferring patient context, but with potential tradeoffs in interpretability. CONCLUSION: Probabilistic topic modeling provides an automated approach to detect thematic trends in patient care and generate decision support content. A potential use case finds related clinical orders for decision support."
34423364,A survey of extant organizational and computational setups for deploying predictive models in health systems.,"OBJECTIVE: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) enabled healthcare is now feasible for many health systems, yet little is known about effective strategies of system architecture and governance mechanisms for implementation. Our objective was to identify the different computational and organizational setups that early-adopter health systems have utilized to integrate AI/ML clinical decision support (AI-CDS) and scrutinize their trade-offs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted structured interviews with health systems with AI deployment experience about their organizational and computational setups for deploying AI-CDS at point of care. RESULTS: We contacted 34 health systems and interviewed 20 healthcare sites (58% response rate). Twelve (60%) sites used the native electronic health record vendor configuration for model development and deployment, making it the most common shared infrastructure. Nine (45%) sites used alternative computational configurations which varied significantly. Organizational configurations for managing AI-CDS were distinguished by how they identified model needs, built and implemented models, and were separable into 3 major types: Decentralized translation (n = 10, 50%), IT Department led (n = 2, 10%), and AI in Healthcare (AIHC) Team (n = 8, 40%). DISCUSSION: No singular computational configuration enables all current use cases for AI-CDS. Health systems need to consider their desired applications for AI-CDS and whether investment in extending the off-the-shelf infrastructure is needed. Each organizational setup confers trade-offs for health systems planning strategies to implement AI-CDS. CONCLUSION: Health systems will be able to use this framework to understand strengths and weaknesses of alternative organizational and computational setups when designing their strategy for artificial intelligence."
34387686,A theory-based meta-regression of factors influencing clinical decision support adoption and implementation.,"OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the study was to explore the theoretical underpinnings of effective clinical decision support (CDS) factors using the comparative effectiveness results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We leveraged search results from a previous systematic literature review and updated the search to screen articles published from January 2017 to January 2020. We included randomized controlled trials and cluster randomized controlled trials that compared a CDS intervention with and without specific factors. We used random effects meta-regression procedures to analyze clinician behavior for the aggregate effects. The theoretical model was the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model with motivational control. RESULTS: Thirty-four studies were included. The meta-regression models identified the importance of effort expectancy (estimated coefficient = -0.162; P = .0003); facilitating conditions (estimated coefficient = 0.094; P = .013); and performance expectancy with motivational control (estimated coefficient = 1.029; P = .022). Each of these factors created a significant impact on clinician behavior. The meta-regression model with the multivariate analysis explained a large amount of the heterogeneity across studies (R2 = 88.32%). DISCUSSION: Three positive factors were identified: low effort to use, low controllability, and providing more infrastructure and implementation strategies to support the CDS. The multivariate analysis suggests that passive CDS could be effective if users believe the CDS is useful and/or social expectations to use the CDS intervention exist. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a modified UTAUT model that includes motivational control is an appropriate model to understand psychological factors associated with CDS effectiveness and to guide CDS design, implementation, and optimization."
36040195,"A smart, practical, deep learning-based clinical decision support tool for patients in the prostate-specific antigen gray zone: model development and validation.","OBJECTIVE: Despite efforts to improve screening and early detection of prostate cancer (PC), no available biomarker has shown acceptable performance in patients with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) gray zones. We aimed to develop a deep learning-based prediction model with minimized parameters and missing value handling algorithms for PC and clinically significant PC (CSPC). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed data from 18 824 prostate biopsies collected between March 2003 and December 2020 from 2 databases, resulting in 12 739 cases in the PSA gray zone of 2.0-10.0 ng/mL. Dense neural network (DNN) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) models for PC and CSPC were developed with 5-fold cross-validation. The area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was compared with that of serum PSA, PSA density, free PSA (fPSA) portion, and prostate health index (PHI). RESULTS: The AUROC values in the DNN model with the imputation of missing values were 0.739 and 0.708 (PC) and 0.769 and 0.742 (CSPC) in internal and external validation, whereas those of the non-imputed dataset were 0.740 and 0.771 (PC) and 0.807 and 0.771 (CSPC), respectively. The performance of the DNN model was like that of the XGBoost model, but better than all tested clinical biomarkers for both PC and CSPC. The developed DNN model outperformed PHI, serum PSA, and percent-fPSA with or without missing value imputation. DISCUSSION: DNN models for missing value imputation can be used to predict PC and CSPC. Further validation in real-life scenarios are need to recommend for actual implementation, but the results from our study support the increasing role of deep learning analytics in the clinical setting. CONCLUSIONS: A deep learning model for PC and CSPC in PSA gray zones using minimal, routinely used clinical parameter variables and data imputation of missing values was successfully developed and validated."
33118943,Integrating the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model With Best Practices in Clinical Decision Support Design: Implementation Science Approach.,"BACKGROUND: Clinical decision support (CDS) design best practices are intended to provide a narrative representation of factors that influence the success of CDS tools. However, they provide incomplete direction on evidence-based implementation principles. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to describe an integrated approach toward applying an existing implementation science (IS) framework with CDS design best practices to improve the effectiveness, sustainability, and reproducibility of CDS implementations. METHODS: We selected the Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model (PRISM) IS framework. We identified areas where PRISM and CDS design best practices complemented each other and defined methods to address each. Lessons learned from applying these methods were then used to further refine the integrated approach. RESULTS: Our integrated approach to applying PRISM with CDS design best practices consists of 5 key phases that iteratively interact and inform each other: multilevel stakeholder engagement, designing the CDS, design and usability testing, thoughtful deployment, and performance evaluation and maintenance. The approach is led by a dedicated implementation team that includes clinical informatics and analyst builder expertise. CONCLUSIONS: Integrating PRISM with CDS design best practices extends user-centered design and accounts for the multilevel, interacting, and dynamic factors that influence CDS implementation in health care. Integrating PRISM with CDS design best practices synthesizes the many known contextual factors that can influence the success of CDS tools, thereby enhancing the reproducibility and sustainability of CDS implementations. Others can adapt this approach to their situation to maximize and sustain CDS implementation success."
30802151,Implementing Precision Medicine in Community-Based Oncology Programs: Three Models.,"The use of precision medicine and the number of genomic-based treatments and immunotherapies is increasing. Nevertheless, oncology providers face challenges to implementing precision medicine, including in community practices, where most patients receive treatment. On January 31, 2018, ASCO hosted Precision Medicine: Expanding Opportunities, the inaugural event in ASCO's new State of Cancer Care in America (SOCCA) event series. This article draws from the inaugural SOCCA event and the experiences of the SOCCA event participants to summarize the opportunities and challenges of precision medicine, and to highlight three successful models of implementing precision oncology in large, multisite community practices or networks: (1) Intermountain Healthcare, (2) Levine Cancer Institute, Atrium Health, and (3) National Cancer Care Alliance. The experience of these practices suggests that practice innovations that offer clinical decision support through molecular tumor boards and clinical pathways, and administrative support for prior authorization and clinical trial matching are key to successful implementation of large-scale, community-based precision medicine programs."

Because microsimulation models are computationally more demanding than traditional Markov cohort models, the use of computer programming languages in their development has become more common. R is a programming language that has gained recognition within the field of decision modeling. It has the capacity to perform microsimulation models more efficiently than software commonly used for decision modeling, incorporate statistical analyses within decision models, and produce more transparent models and reproducible results. However, no clear guidance for the implementation of microsimulation models in R exists. In this tutorial, we provide a step-by-step guide to build microsimulation models in R and illustrate the use of this guide on a simple, but transferable, hypothetical decision problem. We guide the reader through the necessary steps and provide generic R code that is flexible and can be adapted for other models. We also show how this code can be extended to address more complex model structures and provide an efficient microsimulation approach that relies on vectorization solutions."
26677185,Systems Medicine in Oncology: Signaling Network Modeling and New-Generation Decision-Support Systems.,"Two different perspectives are the main focus of this book chapter: (1) A perspective that looks to the future, with the goal of devising rational associations of targeted inhibitors against distinct altered signaling-network pathways. This goal implies a sufficiently in-depth molecular diagnosis of the personal cancer of a given patient. A sufficiently robust and extended dynamic modeling will suggest rational combinations of the abovementioned oncoprotein inhibitors. The work toward new selective drugs, in the field of medicinal chemistry, is very intensive. Rational associations of selective drug inhibitors will become progressively a more realistic goal within the next 3-5 years. Toward the possibility of an implementation in standard oncologic structures of technologically sufficiently advanced countries, new (legal) rules probably will have to be established through a consensus process, at the level of both diagnostic and therapeutic behaviors.(2) The cancer patient of today is not the patient of 5-10 years from now. How to support the choice of the most convenient (and already clinically allowed) treatment for an individual cancer patient, as of today? We will consider the present level of artificial intelligence (AI) sophistication and the continuous feeding, updating, and integration of cancer-related new data, in AI systems. We will also report briefly about one of the most important projects in this field: IBM Watson US Cancer Centers. Allowing for a temporal shift, in the long term the two perspectives should move in the same direction, with a necessary time lag between them."
32810611,Special Commentary: Using Clinical Decision Support Systems to Bring Predictive Models to the Glaucoma Clinic.,"Advances in the field of predictive modeling using artificial intelligence and machine learning have the potential to improve clinical care and outcomes, but only if the results of these models are presented appropriately to clinicians at the time they make decisions for individual patients. Clinical decision support (CDS) systems could be used to accomplish this. Modern CDS systems are computer-based tools designed to improve clinician decision making for individual patients. However, not all CDS systems are effective. Four principles that have been shown in other medical fields to be important for successful CDS system implementation are (1) integration into clinician workflow, (2) user-centered interface design, (3) evaluation of CDS systems and rules, and (4) standards-based development so the tools can be deployed across health systems."
25980878,A public health decision support system model using reasoning methods.,"PROBLEM: Public health programs must be based on the real health needs of the population. However, the design of efficient and effective public health programs is subject to availability of information that can allow users to identify, at the right time, the health issues that require special attention. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this paper is to propose a case-based reasoning model for the support of decision-making in public health. RESULTS: The model integrates a decision-making process and case-based reasoning, reusing past experiences for promptly identifying new population health priorities. A prototype implementation of the model was performed, deploying the case-based reasoning framework jColibri. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed model contributes to solve problems found today when designing public health programs in Colombia. Current programs are developed under uncertain environments, as the underlying analyses are carried out on the basis of outdated and unreliable data."
26262028,The Shared Decision Making Frontier: a Feasibility and Usability Study for Managing Non-Critical Chronic Illness by Combining Behavioural & Decision Theory with Online Technology.,"The objective of this study is to determine if shared decisions for managing non-critical chronic illness, made through an online biomedical technology intervention, us feasible and usable. The technology intervention incorporates behavioural and decision theories to increase patient engagement, and ultimately long term adherence to health behaviour change. We devised the iheart web intervention as a ""proof of concept"" in five phases. The implementation incorporates the Vaadin web application framework, Drools, EclipseLink and a MySQL database. Two-thirds of the study participants favoured the technology intervention, based on Likert-scale questions from a post-study questionnaire. Qualitative analysis of think aloud feedback, video screen captures and open-ended questions from the post-study questionnaire uncovered six main areas or themes for improvement. We conclude that online shared decisions for managing a non-critical chronic illness are feasible and usable through the iheart web intervention."
29968616,Using Innovation-Decision Model to Describe the Adoption to Utilization of HIV-Data for Decision-Making in LMICs.,"Data informed decision-making (DIDM) plays a fundamental role in the fight against HIV and AIDS in Low-and-Middle-Income Countries (LMICs). Despite the scale-up of HIV care services, supported by health information systems (HIS), cases of under-utilization of data in decision-making are still being reported at different levels of the health system. Literature revealing the process involved in data users' decision to adopt DIDM in LMICs is meager. To fill this gap, we employ the innovation-decision model to describe the stages of adoption of DIDM by data users. Thus, we extract reports on efforts to promote DIDM in HIV from existing literature, and map this to the model. We then identify important stages, which require emphasis in the adoption process. Hence, implementers could benefit from use of the innovation-decision model in understanding adoption process of DIDM."
37203761,Modeling Clinical Guidelines for an Epilepsy-CDSS: The EDiTh Project.,"The knowledge transformation process involves the guideline for the diagnosis and therapy of epilepsy to an executable and computable knowledge base that serves as the basis for a decision-support system. We present a transparent knowledge representation model which facilitates technical implementation and verification. Knowledge is represented in a plain table, used in the frontend code of the software where simple reasoning is performed. The simple structure is sufficient and comprehensible also for non-technical persons (i.e., clinicians)."
